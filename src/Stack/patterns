The monotonic stack pattern is used to efficiently solve problems involving next greater,
next smaller, previous greater, and previous smaller elements in arrays. It is particularly
useful in problems involving spans, temperatures, stock prices, and histograms  Trapping Rain Water.

Key Monotonic Stack Patterns
Increasing Stack → Maintains an increasing order (for Next Smaller / Previous Smaller).
Decreasing Stack → Maintains a decreasing order (for Next Greater / Previous Greater).
